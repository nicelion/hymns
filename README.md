## About
This is the official repository for the unofficial Hymns & Hops web app.

Right now, the web app only contains the Hymnal, which can be found [here on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hymns-Hops-All-Good-Things/dp/1091209189/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1JWS6V8AQT4SB&keywords=hymns+and+hops&qid=1676816423&sprefix=hymns+and+hops%2Caps%2C179&sr=8-1)


After visiting Hymns and Hops for many years, the software developer in me knew there might be a better way to distribute hymnals. As such, this project was born.

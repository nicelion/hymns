Thereâ€™s a land that is fairer than day 
And by faith we can see it afar
For the Father waits over the way 
To prepare us a dwelling place there

*In the sweet by and by*
*We shall meet on that beautiful shore* 
*In the sweet by and by*
*We shall meet on that beautiful shore*

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days

We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
The melodious songs of the blessed
And our spirits shall sorrow no more 
We will dance, we will laugh, we will rest

Marvelous grace of our loving Lord
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt 
Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilled

*Grace, grace, God’s grace*
*Grace that will pardon and cleanse within* 
*Grace, grace, God’s grace*
*Grace that is greater than all our sin*

Dark is the stain that we cannot hide 
What can avail to wash it away? Look! 
There is flowing a crimson tide 
Brighter than snow you may be today

Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace 
Freely bestowed on all who believe
You that are longing to see His face
Will you this moment His grace receive?

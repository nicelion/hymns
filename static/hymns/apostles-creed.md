I believe in God the Father Almighty 
Maker of heaven and earth

And in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord 
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit 

Born of the Virgin Mary
Suffered under Pontius Pilate

Was crucified, dead, and buried 
He descended into death

And on the third day he rose again 
He ascended into heaven

And sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty 
From there he shall come to judge the living and the dead

I believe in the Holy Spirit
The holy catholic church 

The communion of saints 
The forgiveness of sins

The resurrection of the body 
And life everlasting

Amen

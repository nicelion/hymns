The Church’s one foundation 
Is Jesus Christ her Lord
She is His new creation
By water and the Word
From heaven He came and sought her 
To be His holy bride
With His own blood He bought her 
And for her life He died

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o’er all the earth
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth 
One holy Name she blesses 
Partakes one holy food
And to one hope she presses 
With every grace endued

’Mid toil and tribulation 
And tumult of her war
She waits the consummation 
Of peace forevermore
Till, with the vision glorious 
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious 
Shall be the Church at rest.

O soul, are you weary and troubled? 
No light in the darkness you see? 
There’s light for a look at the Savior, 
And life more abundant and free

*Turn your eyes upon Jesus*
*Look full in His wonderful face*
*And the things of earth will grow strangely dim I*
*In the light of His glory and grace*

His Word shall not fail you, He promised 
Believe Him and all will be well
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect salvation to tell

Through death into life everlasting 
He passed, and we follow Him there 
O’er us sin no more hath dominion 
For more than His conqu’rors we are!

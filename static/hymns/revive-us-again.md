We praise Thee, O God, For the Son of Thy love 
For Jesus Who died, And is now gone above

We praise Thee, O God, For Thy Spirit of light
Who hath shown us our Savior, And scattered our night

*Hallelujah! Thine the glory Hallelujah!* 
*Amen Hallelujah! Thine the glory* 
*Revive us again*

All glory and praise To the Lamb that was slain
Who hath borne all our sins And hath cleansed every stain

All glory and praise To the God of all grace
Who has sought us and bought us And guided our ways

Revive us again Fill each heart with Thy love 
May each soul be rekindled With fire from above

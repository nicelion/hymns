O worship the King, all glorious above
O gratefully sing His power and His love
Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days 
Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise

O tell of His might, O sing of His grace
Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form 
And dark is His path on the wings of the storm

Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail
In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail 
Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end 
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend

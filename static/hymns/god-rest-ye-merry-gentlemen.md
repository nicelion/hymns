God rest you merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay 
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day 
To save us all from Satan’s pow’r when we were gone astray

*O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy* 
*O tidings of comfort and joy*

From God our heavenly Father a blessed angel came 
And unto certain shepherds the gospel was proclaimed 
That down in Bethlehem was born the son of God by name

Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place 
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace 
For to us our Messiah Jesus comes with truth and grace

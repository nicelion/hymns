Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee, God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee, opening to the sun above 
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away 
Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day

All Thy works with joy surround Thee, earth and heaven reflect Thy rays 
Stars and angels sing around Thee, center of unbroken praise
Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flashing sea 
Singing bird and flowing fountain call us to rejoice in Thee

Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blessed 
Wellspring of the joy of living, ocean depth of happy rest
Thou our Father, Christ our Brother, all who live in love are 
Thine Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine

Mortals, join the happy chorus, which the morning stars began 
Father love is reigning oâ€™er us, brother love binds man to man 
Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife 
Joyful music leads us Sunward in the triumph song of life

Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain. 
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In every change, He faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heavenly Friend 
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake
To guide the future, as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know 
His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.

Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on 
When we shall be forever with the Lord.
When disappointment, grief and fear are gone, 
Sorrow forgot, loveâ€™s purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past 
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

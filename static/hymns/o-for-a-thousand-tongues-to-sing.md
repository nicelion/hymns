O for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer’s praise 
The glories of my God and King the triumphs of His grace

My gracious Master and my God assist me to proclaim 
To spread through all the earth abroad the honors of Thy name

Jesus! the name that calms our fears that bids our sorrows cease 
Tis music in the sinner’s ears, tis life, and health, and peace

He breaks the power of canceled sin, he sets the prisoner free 
His blood can make the foulest clean, His blood availed for me

Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb, Your loosened tongues employ 
Ye blind, behold your Savior come And leap, ye lame, for joy

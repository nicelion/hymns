Come Thou fount of every blessing, tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing call for songs of loudest praise 
Teach me some melodious sonnet sung by flaming tongues above 
Praise the mount I’m fixed upon it mount of Thy redeeming love

Here I raise my Ebenezer, hither by Thy help I come 
And I know by Thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home 
Jesus sought me when a stranger, wandering from the fold of God 
He, to rescue me from danger, interposed His precious blood

Oh, to grace how great a debtor, daily I’m constrained to be 
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, bind my wandering heart to Thee 
Prone to wander Lord I feel it, prone to leave the God I love 
Here’s my heart Lord take and seal it, seal it for Thy courts above

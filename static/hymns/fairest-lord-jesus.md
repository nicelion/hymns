Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all 
Nature Son of God and Son of Man!
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor, 
Thou, my soul’s glory, joy, and crown

Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands 
Robed in the blooming garb of spring
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer
Who makes the woeful heart to sing

Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight 
And all the twinkling starry host
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
Than all the angels heav’n can boast

Beautiful Savior, Lord of the nations 
Son of God and Son of Man
Glory and honor, Praise, adoration 
Now and forevermore be Thine!

I hear the Savior say
Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness, watch and pray 
Find in Me thine all in all.

*Jesus paid it all*
*All to Him I owe*
*Sin had left a crimson stain* 
*He washed it white as snow*

Lord, now indeed I find 
Thy power and Thine alone 
 change the leper’s spots 
 And melt the heart of stone

And when before the throne 
I stand in Him complete 
“Jesus died my soul to save!” 
My lips will still repeat

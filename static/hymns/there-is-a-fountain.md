There is a fountain filled with blood 
Drawn from Immanuel’s veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood 
Lose all their guilty stains

The dying thief rejoiced to see 
That fountain in His day
And there have I, though vile as he 
Washed all my sins away

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood 
Shall never lose its pow’r
Till all the ransomed church of God 
Are safe, to sin no more

When this poor, lisping, stamm’ring tongue 
Lies silent in the grave
Then in a nobler, sweeter song
I’ll sing Thy pow’r to save

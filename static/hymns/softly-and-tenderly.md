Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling 
Calling for you and for me 
See, on the portals heâ€™s waiting and watching 
Watching for you and for me

*Come home, come home* 
*Ye who are weary come home*
*Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling* 
*Calling, O sinner, come home!*

Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing 
Passing from you and from me 
Shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming 
Coming for you and for me

O for the wonderful love he has promised 
Promised for you and for me! 
Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon 
Pardon for you and for me

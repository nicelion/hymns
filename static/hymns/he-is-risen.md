He is risen, he is risen!
Tell it out with joyful voice
Christ has burst his three days’ prison 
Let the whole wide earth rejoice 
Death is conquered, man is free 
Christ has won the victory

Come, ye sad and fearful-hearted 
With glad smiles and radiant brow 
Lent’s long shadows have departed 
All his woes are over now
And the suff ’ring that he bore Sin and pain can vex no more

He is risen, he is risen!
Christ hath opened heaven’s gate 
We are free from sin’s dark prison 
Hail our Lord’s triumphant day 
He is risen, It is true
All our love to him is due

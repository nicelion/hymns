Jesus, I my cross have taken, All to leave and follow Thee 
Destitute, despised, forsaken, Thou, from hence, my all shall be

*Perish every fond ambition, all I’ve sought or hoped or known*
*Yet how rich is my condition! God and heav’n are still my own*

Go now earthly fame and treasure, Come disaster, scorn, and pain 
In Thy service, pain is pleasure With Thy favor, loss is gain

*I have called Thee Abba Father, I have stayed my heart on Thee* 
*Storms may howl and clouds may gather, all shall work for good to me*

Soul, then know thy full salvation, Rise o’er sin and fear and doubt 
Joy to find in every station, His good presence ne’er without

*Think what Spirit dwells within thee, Think what Father’s smiles are thine* 
*Think that Jesus died to win thee, “Child of heaven, thou art Mine”*

Haste thee on from grace to glory, Armed by faith, and winged by prayer 
Heaven’s eternal days before thee, God’s own hand shall guide us there

*Soon shall close thy earthly mission, Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days* 
*Hope shall change to glad fruition, Faith to sight and prayer to praise*

O while Thou dost smile upon me, God of wisdom, love, and might 
Life with trials hard may press me, All eclipsed by heaven’s light

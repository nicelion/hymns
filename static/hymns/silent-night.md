Silent night! Holy night! 
All is calm, all is bright 
’Round yon virgin mother and child! 
Holy infant, so tender and mild, 
Sleep in heavenly peace, 
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night! Holy night! 
Son of God, love’s pure light 
Radiant beams from Thy holy face 
With the dawn of redeeming grace, 
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth! 
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth!

Silent night! Holy night! 
Wondrous star, lend thy light; 
With the angels let us sing 
“Alleluia” to our King: 
“Christ the Savior is born! 
Christ the Savior is born.”

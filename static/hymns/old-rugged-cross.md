On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best 
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

*So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,* 
*Till my trophies at last I lay down;*
*I will cling to the old rugged cross,* 
*And exchange it some day for a crown.*

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, 
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died, 
To pardon and sanctify me.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away, 
Where His glory forever I’ll share.

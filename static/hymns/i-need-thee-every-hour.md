I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord; 
No tender voice like thine can peace afford.

*I need thee, O I need thee, every hour I need thee* 
*O bless me now, my Savior; I come to thee.*

I need thee every hour; stay thou near by; 
Temptations lose their power when thou art nigh

I need thee every hour, in joy or pain; 
Come quickly and abide, or life is vain.

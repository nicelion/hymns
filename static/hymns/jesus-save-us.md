Strong and mighty, King forever 
Wise and just, Emmanuel 
Shine your light, expel this darkness 
Rescue us from sin and self

*O Jesus, save us* 
*Save us, Lord, we pray*

Friend and brother, Helper, Healer 
Perfect love that casts out fear 
Free us from these bonds and shackles 
Give us songs that heaven hears

Matchless beauty, untold worth 
Blood that brings heavâ€™n to earth 
Make our lives louder so 
Your grace and truth the world will know

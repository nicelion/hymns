Hark! the herald angels sing, Glory to the newborn King 
Peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled 
Joyful, all ye nations, rise, join the triumph of the skies 
With angelic hosts proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem

*Hark! the herald angels sing,* 
*Glory to the newborn King*

Christ, by highest heaven adored, Christ, the everlasting Lord 
Late in time behold him come, offspring of the Virginâ€™s womb 
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see; hail incarnate Deity 
Pleased with us in flesh to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel

Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace! Hail the Sun of Righteousness 
Light and life to all he brings, risen with healing in his wings 
Mild he lays his glory by, born that man no more may die 
Born to raise us from the earth, born to give us second birth

Shall we gather at the river 
Where bright angel feet have trod 
With its crystal tide forever 
Flowing by the throne of God?

Yes, we’ll gather at the river
The beautiful, the beautiful river 
Gather with the saints at the river 
That flows by the throne of God

Ere we reach the shining river 
Lay we every burden down 
Grace our spirits will deliver 
And provide a robe and crown

Soon we’ll reach the shining river 
Soon our pilgrimage will cease 
Soon our happy hearts will quiver 
With the melody of peace

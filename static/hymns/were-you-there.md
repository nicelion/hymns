Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb? 
Oh! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble 
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?

Were you there when he rose up from the grave?
Were you there when he rose up from the grave? 
Oh! Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble 
Were you there when he rose up from the grave?

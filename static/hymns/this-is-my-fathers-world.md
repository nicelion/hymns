This is my Father’s world, and to my listening ears 
All nature sings, and round me rings
the music of the spheres

*This is my Father’s world:* 
*I rest me in the thought* 
*Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;*
*His hand the wonders wrought*

This is my Father’s world, the birds their carols raise 
The morning light, the lily white,
declare their Maker’s praise

*This is my Father’s world:* 
*He shines in all that’s fair* 
*In the rustling grass I hear Him pass;*
*He speaks to me everywhere*

This is my Father’s world. O let me ne’er forget 
That though the wrong seems oft so strong, 
God is the ruler yet

*This is my Father’s world, why should my heart be sad* 
*The Lord is King—let the heavens ring;*
*God reigns—let the earth be glad*

*This is my Father’s world:* 
*the battle is not done Jesus* 
*Who died shall be satisfied,*
*And earth and Heav’n be one*

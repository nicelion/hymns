I love to tell the story of unseen things above 
Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love 
I love to tell the story, because I know ’tis true 
It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do

*I love to tell the story, twill be my theme in glory* 
*To tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love*

I love to tell the story, tis pleasant to repeat
What seems, each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet 
I love to tell the story, for some have never heard 
The message of salvation from God’s own holy Word

I love to tell the story, for those who know it best 
Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest 
nd when, in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song 
Twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long

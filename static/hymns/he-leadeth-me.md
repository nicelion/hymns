He leadeth me, O blessed thought! 
O words with heav’nly comfort fraught! 
Whate’er I do, where’er I be 
Still tis God’s hand that leadeth me

*He leadeth me, He leadeth me* 
*By His own hand He leadeth me* 
*His faithful follower I will be* 
*For by His hand He leadeth me*

Lord, I would place my hand in Thine 
Nor ever murmur, nor repine 
Content, whatever I may see 
Since tis my God that leadeth me

And when my task on earth is done 
When by Thy grace the vict’ry’s won 
From death’s cold wave I will not flee 
Since God through Jordan leadeth me

*As I went down in the river to pray* 
*Studying about that good old way* 
*And who shall wear the robe and crown* 
*Good Lord, show me the way*

O brothers let’s go down 
Let’s go down, come on down 
O brothers let’s go down 
Down in the river to pray

O sisters let’s go down 
Let’s go down, come on down 
O sisters let’s go down 
Down in the river to pray

O sinners let’s go down 
Let’s go down, come on down 
O sinners let’s go down 
Down in the river to pray

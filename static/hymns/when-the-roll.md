When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more 
And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair
When the saints of God shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there

When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there

Let us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun 
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care
Then when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done 
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there

On that bright, new Sabbath morning when the dead in Christ shall rise 
And the glory of His resurrection share
When at last we finally see him with our weary, longing eyes
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there

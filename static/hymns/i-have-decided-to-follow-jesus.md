I have decided to follow Jesus 
I have decided to follow Jesus 
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back

Though none go with me, I still will follow 
Though none go with me, I still will follow 
Though none go with me, I still will follow
No turning back, no turning back

The cross before me, the world behind me 
The cross before me, the world behind me 
The cross before me, the world behind me
No turning back, no turning back

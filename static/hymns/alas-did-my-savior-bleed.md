## Alas, Did My Savior Bleed

Alas! and did my Savior bleed, and did my Sovereign die? 
Would He devote that sacred head for sinners such as I?

*At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light* 
*And the burden of my heart rolled away* 
*It was there by faith I received my sight* 
*And now I am happy all the day!*

Was it for crimes that I had done He groaned upon the tree? 
Amazing pity! Grace unknown! And love beyond degree!

Thus might I hide my blushing face while His dear cross appears 
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, and melt my eyes to tears

But drops of grief can neâ€™er repay the debt of love I owe 
Here, Lord, I give my self away, tis all that I can do

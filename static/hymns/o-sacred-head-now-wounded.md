O sacred Head, now wounded
With grief and shame weighed down 
Now scornfully surrounded
With thorns, thine only crown
O sacred Head, what glory
What bliss â€™til now was thine
Yet, though despised and gory
I joy to call thee mine

What language shall I borrow 
To thank thee, dearest Friend 
For this thy dying sorrow
Thy pity without end?
O make me thine for ever 
And should I fainting be Lord, let me never, never 
Outlive my love to thee

Be near when I am dying
O show Thy cross to me
And for my succor flying 
Come, Lord, to set me free 
These eyes new faith receiving 
From Jesus shall not move 
For he who dies believing 
Dies safely, through thy love

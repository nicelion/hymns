What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul! 
What wondrous love is this, O my soul!
What wondrous love is this that caused the Lord of bliss 
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul

When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down 
When I was sinking down, sinking down
When I was sinking down beneath God’s righteous frown 
Christ laid aside His crown for my soul, for my soul 
Christ laid aside His crown for my soul

To God and to the Lamb, I will sing, I will sing
To God and to the Lamb, I will sing, I will sing
To God and to the Lamb, who is the great I Am 
While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing 
While millions join the theme, I will sing

And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on, 
I’ll sing on And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on
And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing His love for me 
And through eternity I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on
And through eternity I’ll sing on

Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne 
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own

*Awake, my soul, and sing of Him who died for me* 
*And hail Him as thy matchless King through all eternity*

Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed over the grave 
And rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save

*His glories now we sing, who died, and rose on high* 
*Who died eternal life to bring, and lives that death may die*

Crown Him the Lord of peace, whose pow’r pours forth great grace 
From pole to pole, that wars may cease, and all be prayer and praise

*All hail, Redeemer, hail! Your songs we’ll ever sing* 
*For Thou, O Lord, art Wonder, Truth, and Holy Majesty*

*His reign shall know no end, and round His pierced feet* 
*Will be our joy with all the saints through all eternity*

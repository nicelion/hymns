## All Creatures

All creatures of our God and King 
Lift up your voice and with us sing, 
O praise Him! Alleluia!

*Thou burning sun with golden beam*
*Thou silver moon with softer gleam!*
*O praise Him! O praise Him!*
*Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!*

Thou rushing wind that art so strong 
Ye clouds that sail in heavâ€™n along
O praise Him! Alleluia!

*Thou rising moon in praise rejoice* 
*Ye lights of evening find a voice*
*O praise Him! O praise Him!* 
*Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!*

Let all things their Creator bless 
And worship Him in humbleness, 
O praise Him! Alleluia!

*Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,* 
*And praise the Spirit, Three in One!*
*O praise Him! O praise Him!*
*Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!*

Let all things their Creator bless 
And worship Him in humbleness, 
O praise Him! Alleluia!

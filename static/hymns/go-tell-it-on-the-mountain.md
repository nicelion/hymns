_Go! tell it on the mountain_
_Over the hills and everywhere_
_Go! tell it on the mountain_
_That Jesus Christ is born_

While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light

The shepherds feared and trembled
When lo! above the earth
Rang out the angels chorus
That hailed the Saviorâ€™s birth

Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

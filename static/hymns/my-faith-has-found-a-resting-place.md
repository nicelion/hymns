My faith has found a resting place 
Not in device or creed
I trust the ever living One
His wounds for me shall plead

*I need no other argument*
*I need no other plea*
*It is enough that Jesus died* 
*And that He died for me*

My heart is leaning on the Word 
The living Word of God 
Salvation by my Saviorâ€™s Name 
Salvation through His blood

My great Physician heals the sick 
The lost He came to save
For me His precious blood 
He shed For me His life He gave

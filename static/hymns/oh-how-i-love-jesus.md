There is a Name I love to hear 
I love to sing its worth 
It sounds like music in my ear 
The sweetest Name on earth

*Oh, how I love Jesus* 
*Oh, how I love Jesus* 
*Oh, how I love Jesus*
*Because He first loved me!*

It tells me of a Savior’s love 
Who died to set me free 
It tells me of His precious blood 
The sinner’s perfect plea

It bids my trembling heart rejoice 
It dries each rising tear 
It tells me, in a still small voice, 
To trust and never fear

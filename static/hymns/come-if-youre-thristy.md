Come if you’re thirsty
Come if you’re thirsty
Come and drink and never thirst again

Come if you’re hungry
Come if you’re hungry
Come and eat the bread broken for you

Come you tired and weary
Come you tired and weary
Come and rest your heavy heart in His

Come to the fountain
Come to the fountain
Come and drown yours sins in Jesus’ blood

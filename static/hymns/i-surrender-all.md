All to Jesus I surrender 
All to Him I freely give 
I will ever love and trust Him 
In His presence daily live

*I surrender all, I surrender all* 
*All to Thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all*

All to Jesus I surrender 
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine 
Let me feel the Holy Spirit 
Truly know that Thou art mine

All to Jesus I surrender 
Lord, I give myself to Thee 
Fill me with Thy love and power 
Let Thy blessing fall on me

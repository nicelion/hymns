I’m so glad Jesus lifted me
I’m so glad Jesus lifted me
I’m so glad Jesus lifted me
Singing, “Glory hallelujah! Jesus lifted me!”

Satan had me bound, but Jesus lifted me 
Satan had me bound, but Jesus lifted me 
Satan had me bound, but Jesus set me free! 
Singing, “Glory hallelujah! Jesus lifted me!”

When I was afraid, Jesus lifted me
When I was afraid, Jesus lifted me
When I was afraid, Jesus lifted me
Singing, “Glory hallelujah! Jesus lifted me!”

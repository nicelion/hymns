God be with you till we meet again 
By His counsels guide, uphold you 
With His sheep securely fold you God be with you till we meet again

*Till we meet, till we meet* 
*Till we meet at Jesus’ feet* 
*Till we meet, till we meet* 
*God be with you till we meet again*

God be with you till we meet again 
‘Neath His wings securely hide you 
Daily manna still provide you 
God be with you till we meet again

God be with you till we meet again 
When life’s perils thick confound you 
Put His arms unfailing round you 
God be with you till we meet again

God be with you till we meet again
Keep love’s banner floating o’er you 
Smite death’s threat’ning wave before you 
God be with you till we meet again

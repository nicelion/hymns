O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie 
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by 
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light 
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary and, gathered all above 
While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wond’ring love
O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth 
And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently the wondrous gift is giv’n 
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His heav’n 
No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin 
Where meek souls will receive Him still the dear Christ enters in

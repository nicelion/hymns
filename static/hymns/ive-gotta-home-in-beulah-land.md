I’ve gotta home in Beulah Land that outshines the sun 
I’ve gotta home in Beulah Land that outshines the sun 
I’ve gotta home in Beulah Land that outshines the sun 
Way beyond the blue

I can’t wait to see my Lord, and sing the angel songs 
I can’t wait to see my Lord, and sing the angel songs 
I can’t wait to see my Lord, and sing the angel songs 
Way beyond the blue

Come on, let’s go to Beulah Land on the other side 
Come on, let’s go to Beulah Land on the other side 
Come on, let’s go to Beulah Land on the other side 
Way beyond the blue

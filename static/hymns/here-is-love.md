Here is love, vast as the ocean 
Lovingkindness as a flood
When the Prince of Life, our Ransom 
Shed for us His precious blood
Who His love will not remember? 
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He will never be forgotten 
Throughout Heav’n’s endless days

On the mount of crucifixion 
Fountains opened deep and wide 
Through the floodgates of God’s mercy 
Flowed a vast and gracious tide
Grace and love, like mighty rivers 
Poured incessant from above
And Heav’n’s peace and perfect justice 
Kissed a guilty world in love

Let me, all Thy love accepting,
Love Thee, ever all my days
Let me seek Thy kingdom only
And my life be to Thy praise
Thou alone shall be my glory 
Nothing in the world I see
Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me 
Thou alone has set me free

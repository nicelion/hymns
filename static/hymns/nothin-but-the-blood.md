What can wash away my sin? 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
What can make me whole again? 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

*Oh! precious is the flow that makes me white as snow* 
*No other fount I know, Nothing but the blood of Jesus*

Nothing can for sin atone, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
Not of good that I have done, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

This is all my hope and peace, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
This is all my righteousness, 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

O come, O come, Emmanuel 
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here 
Until the Son of God appear

*Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel* 
*Shall come to thee, O Israel.*

O come, Thou Day-Spring, come
And cheer our spirits by Thine advent here 
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And deathâ€™s dark shadows put to flight.

O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder 
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made 
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder 
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

*Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee* 
*How great Thou art, how great Thou art* 
*Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee* 
*How great Thou art, how great Thou art*

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing 
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in 
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing 
He bled and died to take away my sin

When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation 
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart 
Then I shall bow in humble adoration 
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art

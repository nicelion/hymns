If the world from you withhold of its silver and its gold 
And you have to get along with meager fare 
Just remember, in God’s Word, how He feeds the little birds 
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there.

*Leave it there, leave it there* 
*Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there* 
*If you trust and never doubt, He will surely bring you out* 
*Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there*

If your body suffers pain and your health you can’t regain 
And your soul is almost sinking in despair 
Jesus knows the pain you feel, He can save and He can heal 
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there

When your youthful days are gone and old age is stealing on 
And your body bends beneath the weight of care 
He will never leave you then, He’ll go with you to the end 
Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there

Come, thou Almighty King 
Help us thy name to sing, help us to praise 
Father all glorious, o’er all victorious 
Come and reign over us, Ancient of Days!

Come, Thou Incarnate Word 
Gird on thy mighty sword, our prayer attend 
Come, and Thy people bless, and give Thy 
Word success Spirit of holiness, on us descend!

Come holy Comforter, Thy sacred witness bear in this glad hour 
Thou Who Almighty art, now rule in every heart 
And ne’er from us depart, Spirit of pow’r!

To Thee, great One in Three 
Eternal praises be, hence, evermore 
Thy sov’reign Majesty, may we in glory see 
And to eternity love and adore!

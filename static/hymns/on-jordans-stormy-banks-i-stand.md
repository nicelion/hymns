On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand, and cast a wishful eye 
To Canaan’s fair and happy land, where my possessions lie.

*I am bound, I am bound* 
*I am bound for the promised land*

All o’er those wide extended plains shines one eternal day 
There God the Son forever reigns, and scatters night away.

No chilling winds nor poisonous breath can reach that healthful shore; 
Where sickness, sorrow, pain, and death are felt and feared no more.

When shall I reach that happy place and be forever blessed? 
When shall I see my Father’s face, And in His bosom rest?

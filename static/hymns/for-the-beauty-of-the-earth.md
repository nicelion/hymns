For the beauty of the earth 
For the glory of the skies 
For the love which from our birth 
Over and around us lies

*Lord of all, to thee we raise* 
*This our hymn of grateful praise.*

For the beauty of each hour 
Of the day and of the night 
Hill and vale, and tree and flower 
Sun and moon, and stars of light

For the joy of human love 
Brother, sister, parent, child 
Friends on earth and friends above 
For all gentle thoughts and mild

For thyself, best Gift Divine 
To the world so freely given 
For that great, great love of thine 
Peace on earth, and joy in heaven

## A Mighty Fortress

A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing 
Our helper he amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing 
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe
His craft and power are great, and armed with cruel hate 
On earth is not his equal

Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing 
Were not the right man on our side, the man of God’s own choosing 
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he
Lord Sabaoth, his name, from age to age the same
And he must win the battle

And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us 
We will not fear, for God hath willed his truth to triumph through us 
The prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him
His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure
One little word shall fell him

That word above all earthly powers, no thanks to them, abideth 
The Spirit and the gifts are ours, thru him who with us sideth 
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also
The body they may kill; God’s truth abideth still
His kingdom is forever

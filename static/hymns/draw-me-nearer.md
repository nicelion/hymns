I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice 
And it told Thy love to me B
ut I long to rise in the arms of faith 
And be closer drawn to Thee

*Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord* 
*To the cross where Thou hast died* 
*Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed* 
*Lord To Thy precious, bleeding side*

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour 
That before Thy throne I spend 
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God 
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love that I cannot know 
Till I cross the narrow sea 
There are heights of joy that I may not reach 
Till I rest in peace with Thee

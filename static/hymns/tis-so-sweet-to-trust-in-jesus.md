Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take him at his word;
Just to rest upon his promise,
And to know, “Thus saith the Lord.”

*Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!* 
*How I’ve proved him o’er and o’er!* 
*Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!*
*O for grace to trust him more!*

Yes, ‘tis sweet to trust in Jesus, 
Just from sin and self to cease; 
Just from Jesus simply taking 
Life and rest, and joy and peace.

I’m so glad I learned to trust thee, 
Precious Jesus, Savior, friend;
And I know that thou art with me, 
Wilt be with me to the end.

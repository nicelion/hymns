Would you be free from the burden of sin? 
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood; 
Would you o’er evil a victory win? 
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood

*There is pow’r, pow’r, wonder-working pow’r* 
*In the blood of the Lamb;* 
*There is pow’r, pow’r, wonder-working pow’r* 
*In the precious blood of the Lamb*

Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow? 
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood; 
Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow; 
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood.

Would you do service for Jesus your King? 
There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood; 
Would you live daily His praises to sing? 
There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood.

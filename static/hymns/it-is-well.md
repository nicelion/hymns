When peace, like a river, attendeth my way 
When sorrows like sea billows roll 
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say 
It is well, it is well, with my soul

*It is well, with my soul* 
*It is well, it is well, with my soul*

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come 
Let this blest assurance control 
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood for my soul

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought 
My sin, not in part but the whole 
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul

Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight 
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll 
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend 
Even so, it is well with my soul

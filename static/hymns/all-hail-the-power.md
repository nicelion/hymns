All hail the power of Jesus’ Name! Let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all 
Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all

Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race, ye ransomed from the fall 
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all 
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all

Let every kindred, every tribe on this terrestrial ball 
To him all majesty ascribe and crown him Lord of all 
To him all majesty ascribe and crown him Lord of all

O that, with yonder sacred throng, we at His feet may fall 
We’ll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all
 We’ll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all

I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me 
A sinner, condemned, unclean.

*O how marvelous! O how wonderful!* 
*And my song shall ever be*
*O how marvelous! O how wonderful!* 
*Is my Saviorâ€™s love for me!*

He took my sins and my sorrows 
He made them His very own 
He bore the burden to Calvary 
And suffered and died alone

When with the ransomed in glory 
His face I at last shall see
Twill be my joy through the ages 
To sing of His love for me!

Jesus! what a Friend for sinners! Jesus! Lover of my soul!
Friends may fail me, foes assail me, He, my Savior, makes me whole

*Hallelujah! what a Savior!* 
*Hallelujah! what a Friend!* 
*Saving, helping, keeping, loving* 
*He is with me to the end*

Jesus! what a Help in sorrow! While the billows oâ€™er me roll 
Even when my heart is breaking, He, my Master, helps my soul

Jesus! I do now adore Him! More than all in Him I find 
He hath granted me forgiveness, I am His, and He is mine

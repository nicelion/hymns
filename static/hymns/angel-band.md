## Angel Band

My latest sun is sinking fast 
My race is nearly run My strongest trials now are past 
My triumph has begun

*Oh, come, angel band* 
*Come and around me stand* 
*Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings to my immortal home* 
*Oh, bear me away on your snow-white wings to my immortal home*

Oh, bear my longing heart to Him 
Who bled and died for me 
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin 
And gives me victory

I know I’m near the holy ranks 
Of friends and kindred dear 
I hear the waves on Jordan’s banks 
The crossing must be near

How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word 
What more can He say than to you He hath said 
You, who unto Jesus for refuge have fled

Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed
For I am thy God and will still give thee aid
I’ll strengthen and help thee, and cause thee to stand 
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand

When through waters deep I shall call thee to go 
The rivers of suff ’ring shall not overflow
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress

The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose
I will not, I will not desert to its foes
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake 
I’ll never, no never, no never forsake

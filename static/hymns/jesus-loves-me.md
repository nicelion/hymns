Jesus loves me! This I know 
For the Bible tells me so 
Little ones to Him belong 
They are weak, but He is strong

*Yes, Jesus loves me!* 
*Yes, Jesus loves me!* 
*Yes, Jesus loves me!*
*For the Bible tells me so*

Jesus loves me! He who died 
Heavenâ€™s gate to open wide 
He will wash away my sin 
Let His little child come in

Jesus loves me! He will stay 
Close beside me all the way 
Thou hast bled and died for me 
I will henceforth live for Thee

Not what my hands have done can save my guilty soul 
Not what my toiling flesh has borne can make my spirit whole 
Not what I feel or do can give me peace with God 
Not all my prayers and sighs and tears can bear my awful load

*These guilty hands are raised, filthy rags are all I bring* 
*And I have come to hide beneath Your wings* 
*These holy hands are raised, washed in the fountain of Your grace* 
*And now I wear Your righteousness*

Thy work alone, oh Christ can ease this weight of sin 
Thy blood alone, oh Lamb of God can give me peace within 
Thy love to me, oh God, not mine, oh Lord to Thee 
Can rid me of this dark unrest and set my spirit free
Thy grace alone, oh God to me, can pardon speak 
Thy power alone, oh Lamb of God, can this sore bondage break? 
No other work save Thine, no other blood will do 
No strength but that which is divine can bear me safely through

I praise the God of grace, I trust His truth and might 
He calls me His, I call Him mine, my God, my joy, my light 
My Lord has saved my life and freely pardon gives 
I love because He first loved me, I live because He lives
